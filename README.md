# rsa

This program was made for a Lab Assignment in a beginner Software Security Principles class.
The assignment was to create a toy RSA Encryption algorithm in any language we wanted. 
Because I was just beginning to learn JavaScript, that is the language I chose.
We had to complete the following tasks: 
  Generate two large random prime numbers
  Generate public and private keys
  Encrypt a message using our instructor's public key
  Encrypt a message with our private key and sent it to our instructor with our public key for them to decrypt
Now that I know more JavaScript, I would like to clean this up at some point.
